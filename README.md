# Mapping_Earthquakes
Overview:

In this project, my duties were to helped Basil and Sadhana to create a map to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and adding the data on a third map.

in order to achieve that, I utilized Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
